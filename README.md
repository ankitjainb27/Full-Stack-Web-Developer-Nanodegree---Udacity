Link to the app's api explorer is [here](https://apis-explorer.appspot.com/apis-explorer/?base=https://hangman-1469790942131.appspot.com/_ah/api#p/).

## Set-Up Instructions:
1.  Update the value of application in app.yaml to the app ID you have registered
 in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host your instance of this sample.
1.  Run the app with the devserver using dev_appserver.py DIR, and ensure it's
 running by visiting the API Explorer - by default localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer.
1.  (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with the endpoints tool.
 Deploy your application.


##Game Description:
Hangman is a game where the player needs to guess the letter of a word.
He can uses the number of dashes to know the no. of letter in the word and already guessed word to correctly guess the whole word.
Each game begins with a random 'target' word.
'Guesses' are sent to the `make_move` endpoint which will reply
with either: list of 'alphabets_history' and list of 'game_history', attempts_remaining.
Many different Hangman games can be played by many different Users at any
given time. Each game can be retrieved or played by using the path parameter
`urlsafe_game_key`.

##Score Keeping
Score is kept when the game is over. It is stored if the user, won or lost the game and the no. of guesses he made in the game.
High score includes entries that won and in descending order based on weighted score.
 - User ranking is based on weighted score
 - To calculate it the formula
 - First we get a state, which is 1 for win and 0 for loss
 - Final formula is = sum(state*guess)/(sum(guess))

##Files Included:
