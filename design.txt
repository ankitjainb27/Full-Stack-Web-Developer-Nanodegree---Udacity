Design documents indicating what design decision I took and why.

1) User :
I added 'remainder' field to enable users to choose whether they want to receive a reminder every one hour to play Hangman.
Also, I made the default as False of remainder so that they get the remainder only if they choose the same.

2) Game :
Variables
a)I added 'game_cancel' field to be able to cancel a game. A user can't make a move is game is cancelled.
b)I added 'game_history' field to keep the history of Hangman game. It stores the letter the user guesses right and for the other ones it is a '_'.
c)I added 'alphabets_history' field to refrain user to guessing a letter they already guesses and waste an attempt.
d)I added 'to_form_with_history' function to put 'game_history', 'alphabets_history', 'game_cancel'

3)GameForm:
Added 'game_history', 'alphabets_history' and 'game_cancel' to pass it in response.

4)GameForms:
It is used to create a list of GameForm

Challenges:
Due to No-SQL nature of DataStore it was difficult to group_by in get_user_rankings.
Thus, I used iteration and made a dict with key as user_name and dict of performance and guesses as value.
